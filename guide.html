The interior is very beautiful: hand-painted stained glass windows, statues of biblical characters, walls of white marble with a large number of icons. In the center of the main hall is an ancient altar. On the territory of the cathedral there is a crypt, in which 80 persons of royal blood found shelter.</p>

<h2>2. Old National Gallery (Alte Nationalgalerie)</h2>
<p> Connoisseurs of classical fine art should definitely visit the Nationalgalerie in Berlin. The National Gallery has existed in the German capital for 157 years, representing a unique collection of art works of the XIX-XXI centuries. Today, the entire collection is housed in 5 buildings, separating art objects from different centuries. The art of the XIX century, including the masterpieces of such famous artists as Adolf von Menzel, Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, is collected in the Old National Gallery on Museum Island.</p>
<h2>3. Gendarmenmarkt</h2>
<p>This is the name of the square in the center of the German capital. A similar Roman landmark, the Piazza del Popolo, is taken as a model. Gendarmenmarkt was founded in the middle of the XVII century as the main place of street trade. Then it was called "The Fake market". In the middle of the XVIII century, the square was built up with compact three-story buildings. On the north side of the Gendarmenmarkt is the French Cathedral, on the south-the German Cathedral. There are also many hotels, shops, cafes around. Berlin's most popular Christmas market opens here in November.</p>
